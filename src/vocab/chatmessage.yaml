  `ChatMessage`s are the messages sent in 1-on-1 chats.  They are similar to
  {@link Note}s, but the addressing is done by having a single AP actor in
  the `to` field.  Addressing multiple actors is not allowed.  These messages
  are always private, there is no public version of them.  They are created with
  a {@link Create} activity.

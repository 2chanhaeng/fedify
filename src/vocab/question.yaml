  Represents a question being asked.  Question objects are an extension of
  {@link IntransitiveActivity}.  That is, the Question object is an Activity,
  but the direct object is the question itself and therefore it would not
  contain an `object` property.

  Either of the `anyOf` and `oneOf` properties *may* be used to express possible
  answers, but a Question object *must not* have both properties.

  An Activity is a subtype of {@link Object} that describes some form of action
  that may happen, is currently happening, or has already happened.
  The {@link Activity} type itself serves as an abstract base type for all types
  of activities.  It is important to note that the {@link Activity} type itself
  does not carry any specific semantics about the kind of action being taken.
